eCommerce-Website

This website is built on ruby on rails using version 2.7 of ruby and 5.2.8 of rails. Twenty three Gemfile dependencies and 92 gems are used for this application.
We have made six models and controllers for user, product and comment with their corresponding views. In this app, the buyer can add products to his cart, comment about them and place order. The seller can create, edit and delete products but he can not comment about products or add them to his cart. The roles of buyer and seller are completely different. 
For UI, I have mainly used HTML and CSS.
